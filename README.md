# github-tabstop

Hard-tab-indented source code, when displayed by Github/Gist, has hard tabs
(`\t`s) displayed in the browser as-is, which are usually rendered as 8 spaces
in modern browsers. This is often undesirable (especially for golang code,
where the standard specifies 4-space hard tabs).

After a ignored feature request of user-changeable tabstop to Github, I decided
to implement this as a userscript instead.

Enjoy!
